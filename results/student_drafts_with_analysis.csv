101,1,8882287307308084,A number is 35 less than 24 times 145. What is this number?,3345,3445,"The student made a mistake during the multiplication process, leading to an incorrect final answer.",https://img1.classba.cn/cimages/90ad521c1e42c01eecc797115e946972.png,Calculation Error,"The student made a mistake in the multiplication step. When calculating the first partial product (145 x 4), they correctly carried over a '1' from the tens column (4x4=16, plus the carried 2, makes 18). However, they forgot to add this carried '1' to the result of 4x1 in the hundreds column. They wrote 4 instead of 5, resulting in 480 instead of the correct 580."
102,2,8888025590665607,What is the area of the land shown in the figure in square decimeters?,72900,729,"The student did not correctly understand the units for the final answer and mistakenly converted the area from square decimeters to square centimeters, leading to an incorrect answer.",https://img1.classba.cn/cimages/c2139f011daa7a95f03c2581c1e5e066.jpg,Procedural Error,"The student correctly set up the multiplication as 450 × 190 and accurately calculated the first partial product (450 × 90 = 40,500). The mistake occurred in the second step of the multiplication. Instead of calculating the second partial product by multiplying 450 by the 1 in the hundreds place (450 × 100 = 45,000), the student incorrectly used the value 32,400. The final addition was performed correctly on the wrong numbers."
