101,1,8882287307308084,A number is 35 less than 24 times 145. What is this number?,3345,3445,"The student made a mistake during the multiplication process, leading to an incorrect final answer.",https://img1.classba.cn/cimages/90ad521c1e42c01eecc797115e946972.png,Calculation Error,"The student correctly identified the two steps needed: multiplication and then subtraction. The mistake occurred during the multiplication of 145 by 24. When calculating the first partial product (145 x 4), the student forgot to add the '1' that was carried over from the tens place calculation (4x4+2=18). They wrote down 4 in the hundreds place instead of 5, resulting in a partial product of 480 instead of the correct 580. All subsequent calculations were performed correctly based on this initial error."
102,2,8888025590665607,What is the area of the land shown in the figure in square decimeters?,72900,729,"The student did not correctly understand the units for the final answer and mistakenly converted the area from square decimeters to square centimeters, leading to an incorrect answer.",https://img1.classba.cn/cimages/c2139f011daa7a95f03c2581c1e5e066.jpg,Procedural Error,"The student correctly identified that the area should be calculated by multiplying the dimensions, 450 and 490. They also correctly calculated the first partial product: 90 × 450 = 40,500. The mistake occurred in the next step of the long multiplication. Instead of calculating the second partial product (400 × 450), the student appears to have substituted the result of a different calculation (which seems to be 180 × 180 = 32,400). The correct second partial product should have been 400 × 450 = 180,000."
