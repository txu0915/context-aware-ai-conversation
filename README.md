### üìñ Tutorial Abstract

As AI-driven educational systems advance, the challenge lies in designing human-machine interactions that are pedagogically effective and adaptive. This tutorial introduces Socratic AI Tutoring, a structured framework that engages students in interactive, step-by-step guidance to understand and correct their own mistakes. By leveraging multimodal AI to pre-analyze a student's work, our tutor is context-aware from the first interaction, enabling personalized and highly effective learning dialogues.

### ‚ú® What You'll Learn & Build

By the end of this 2-hour tutorial, you will have built and evaluated a complete Socratic tutoring system. You will:

*   üß† **Perform Multimodal Error Analysis:** Use Google Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze a student's handwritten work, identify their specific mistake, and categorize it into a structured format.
*   üí¨ **Build a Dual-Chat Interface:** Create and compare two AI tutors side-by-side‚Äîone that is context-aware and one that is not‚Äîto vividly demonstrate the UX benefits of context.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è **Create an Automated Evaluation Framework:** Use an LLM as an impartial judge to score conversation quality against a 6-point pedagogical rubric, turning qualitative interactions into quantitative data.

### üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized to be clean and modular:

### üöÄ Getting Started: From Zero to Ready in 5 Steps

Follow these steps to set up your environment.

#### Step 0: Prerequisites (For Absolute Beginners)

This tutorial requires a **specific version of Python (3.13.2)** to ensure a smooth, error-free experience for everyone.

1.  **Install Git:**
    *   **Check if installed:** Open a terminal (or PowerShell on Windows) and type `git --version`. If you see a version number, you're set.
    *   **How to install:** Download from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2.  **Install Python 3.13.2:**
    *   **Check your version:** In your terminal, type `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
    *   **How to install:**
        1.  Go to the official download page for **Python 3.13.2**: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/)
        2.  Download the installer for your operating system (e.g., "Windows installer (64-bit)" or "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer").
        3.  Run the installer. **Important:** On Windows, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
        
#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project, and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/txu0915/context-aware-ai-conversation.git
cd context-aware-ai-conversation
```

### Step 2: Get Your Google Gemini API Key
This project uses the Google Gemini API. It has a generous free tier that is perfect for this tutorial.
Go to Google AI Studio.
Sign in with your Google account.
Click on "Get API key" and then "Create API key in new project".
Copy the generated key. You will need it in the next step.

### Step 3: Run the Automated Setup Script
We've created a script that handles everything for you: it creates a virtual environment, installs all required packages, and prepares your configuration file.
For macOS and Linux:
```
bash setup.sh
```
For Windows:
```
setup.bat
```

### Step 4: Add Your API Key
The setup script created a file named .env in your project directory.
Open the .env file with any text editor.
Replace the placeholder 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with the Gemini API key you copied earlier.
Save and close the file.

### Step 5: Activate Your Environment & Launch
Activate the virtual environment in your terminal:
macOS/Linux: ```source venv/bin/activate```
Windows: ```venv\Scripts\activate```
You'll know it's active when you see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.
Launch Jupyter Lab:
```jupyter lab```

This will open a new tab in your browser with the Jupyter Lab interface.
üíª Running the Tutorial Notebooks
Navigate to the notebooks directory in the Jupyter Lab file browser. Run the notebooks in the following order:
    01_Error_Aware_Retrieval.ipynb: Analyze student drafts with a multimodal AI and generate a structured analysis file.
    02_Context_Aware_Dialogue.ipynb: Launch the side-by-side chat interface and interact with the two different AI tutors.
    03_Conversational_Evaluation.ipynb: Automatically evaluate your saved conversation logs and visualize the performance comparison.
üîß Troubleshooting
Problem: The chat widgets in Notebook 02 are not appearing or are stuck loading.
Solution: Your Jupyter Lab may be missing the required frontend extension. Stop Jupyter Lab (Ctrl+C in terminal), make sure your (venv) is active, and run:
```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```
Then, restart jupyter lab.
