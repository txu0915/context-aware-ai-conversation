### üìñ Tutorial Abstract

As AI-driven educational systems advance, the challenge lies in designing human-machine interactions that are pedagogically effective and adaptive. This tutorial introduces Socratic AI Tutoring, a structured framework that engages students in interactive, step-by-step guidance to understand and correct their own mistakes. By leveraging multimodal AI to pre-analyze a student's work, our tutor is context-aware from the first interaction, enabling personalized and highly effective learning dialogues.

### ‚ú® What You'll Learn & Build

By the end of this 2-hour tutorial, you will have built and evaluated a complete Socratic tutoring system. You will:

*   üß† **Perform Multimodal Error Analysis:** Use Google Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze a student's handwritten work, identify their specific mistake, and categorize it into a structured format.
*   üí¨ **Build a Dual-Chat Interface:** Create and compare two AI tutors side-by-side‚Äîone that is context-aware and one that is not‚Äîto vividly demonstrate the UX benefits of context.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è **Create an Automated Evaluation Framework:** Use an LLM as an impartial judge to score conversation quality against a 6-point pedagogical rubric, turning qualitative interactions into quantitative data.
